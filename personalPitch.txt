I'm an early software engineer with a year of experience
in e-commerce enterprise development. Looking to join a
team to professionally develop, learn, and contribute my
Java and wed development skills. In previous roles, I
worked closely with product and developers to confirm
completed software met requirements. I also worked
closely with the team on the scope of future projects
and innovations. Currently enrolled in the coding
bootcamp, Springboard, set to finish by the end of 2021.
